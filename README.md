Isomorphic HTML generation using opinionated JSON as a template

Opensourced from: https://bitbucket.org/evansaf/iolmobile-jx

```
$ git clone https://github.com/evanx/jx.git
jx$ cd jx
jx$ npm install
jx$ nodejs test/example.js
```

The "library" is `src/jx.js` which is 100-odd lines of code, so quite minimal.

```
jx$ cat src/jx.js | grep ';' | wc -l 
112
```
